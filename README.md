# BarBot - Autonomous Drink Delivery
BarBot is my first term Mechatronics design project created alongside [Dylan Finlay](https://github.com/DylanFinlay), Marlon Podollagoda and Warren Cao.

BarBot works to reduce the workload of servers by autonomously picking up drinks from the bar, delivers to the correct tables, accepts a tap payment, then returns to the bar to continue its delivery service until no longer needed.

## Features
- Height Adjustable tray
- Cutom 3D modeled and printed cup stabilizing tray
- Mathematical based acceleration and de-acceleration
- 180 degree field of vision object detection
- Object detection and avoidance routine

and more!

## Hardware and Software Stack
The chasis of BarBot was fully custom made using lego, and uses a LEGO EV3 brick to control sensors and motors for movement and functions. The software was developped using ROBOTC, an EV3 specific text based language designed for EV3s.
